# Data Visualisation Project

This repository contains my MSc Data Science coursework for the COMP1800 Data Visualisation module. The project focuses on visual exploration and analysis of customer data from ChrisCo, a fictional cinema chain, using Python visualisation techniques.

## **Disclaimer**
This repository contains code and data for educational purposes as part of my coursework. Please do not copy or reuse this code for your own coursework or projects without permission.

## Project Overview
The goal of this coursework is to explore ChrisCoâ€™s customer data and identify insights related to visitor demographics, cinema capacity, spending patterns, and seasonal trends. This analysis includes static and interactive visualisations to facilitate a deeper understanding of high, medium, and low-volume cinemas across various metrics.

## Repository Contents
- **Notebook (`data_visualisation.ipynb`)**: A Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, data transformation, and visualisations. Key contents include:
  - Data preparation and merging of customer data.
  - 8 selected visualisations, including interactive elements, to illustrate key insights.
  - Markdown explanations for each visualisation, highlighting insights and patterns.
- **Report (`data_visualisation_report.pdf`)**: A comprehensive PDF report summarising the visualisation findings. The report includes:
  - An introduction to data visualisation and its importance.
  - Justification for each visualisation, detailing why it was chosen and what it reveals about the data.
  - A critical review discussing the visualisation process and reflections.
  - Conclusions that summarise the main findings about ChrisCo's cinema data.

## Key Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Integration of multiple datasets (e.g., cinema visits, average age, capacity) into summary data for analysis.
2. **Visualisation Techniques**:
   - Use of bar charts, radar charts, line graphs, seasonal decomposition, and heatmaps to reveal patterns.
   - Interactive plots for exploring weekly visits and correlations.
3. **Analysis Focus**:
   - Identifying high, medium, and low-volume cinemas and analysing their performance.
   - Detecting seasonal trends, outliers, and correlations among various cinema metrics.


## Results
The analysis provides ChrisCo with insights into customer behaviour and cinema performance. Trends in seasonal visits, spending, and demographic patterns are highlighted to assist in strategic planning and operational improvements.
