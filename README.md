# Data Visualisation Coursework - COMP1800

This repository contains my MSc Data Science coursework for the COMP1800 Data Visualisation module. The project focuses on visual exploration and analysis of customer data from ChrisCo, a fictional cinema chain, using Python visualisation techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this coursework is to explore ChrisCoâ€™s customer data and identify insights related to visitor demographics, cinema capacity, spending patterns, and seasonal trends. This analysis includes static and interactive visualisations to facilitate a deeper understanding of high, medium, and low-volume cinemas across various metrics.

## Repository Contents
- **Notebook (`data_visualisation.ipynb`)**: A Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, data transformation, and visualisations. Key contents include:
  - Data preparation and merging of customer data.
  - 8 selected visualisations, including interactive elements, to illustrate key insights.
  - Markdown explanations for each visualisation, highlighting insights and patterns.
- **Report (`data_visualisation_report.pdf`)**: A comprehensive PDF report summarising the visualisation findings. The report includes:
  - An introduction to data visualisation and its importance.
  - Justification for each visualisation, detailing why it was chosen and what it reveals about the data.
  - A critical review discussing the visualisation process and reflections.
  - Conclusions that summarise the main findings about ChrisCo's cinema data.

## Key Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Integration of multiple datasets (e.g., cinema visits, average age, capacity) into summary data for analysis.
2. **Visualisation Techniques**:
   - Use of bar charts, radar charts, line graphs, seasonal decomposition, and heatmaps to reveal patterns.
   - Interactive plots for exploring weekly visits and correlations.
3. **Analysis Focus**:
   - Identifying high, medium, and low-volume cinemas and analysing their performance.
   - Detecting seasonal trends, outliers, and correlations among various cinema metrics.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the repository files to your local machine.
2. **Run the Notebook**: Open `data_visualisation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. Make sure to have required libraries installed to view interactive plots.
3. **Review the Report**: Open `data_visualisation_report.pdf` to get an overview of findings and visualisation justifications.

## Results
The analysis provides ChrisCo with insights into customer behaviour and cinema performance. Trends in seasonal visits, spending, and demographic patterns are highlighted to assist in strategic planning and operational improvements.
